#This is example for CAN_BUS standart format. Basicly this is communucation between 2 board. 1 sending message then other response. The message triggered by user button. after that constantly they keep sending message and other board responses. 
Also Hardware part added. I am using pca82c250 Can IC and 6n137 Opto-coupler.
Also this project is goes with blinky_slave. This one is for master and the other one is slave.
But to be honest in reality there is no master or slave on this network. Just 2 node talking to each other
